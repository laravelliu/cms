                    <p>Our customers have been placing their trust in the experience and quality standards of Canava  Transport’s Multimodal Transport Services department for the past 5 years. The Multimodal Transport Services department handles national and international transports, mainly by rail or inland waterway. The Multimodal Transport Services department not only optimises the transport chains to the North Ports and the West Ports, but also to the South Ports. The integration of all Canava  Transport locations means that the majority of transported containers are delivered or collected using our own trucks. This guarantees consistently high quality of the supply chain.</p>
                    <p>Our customers in this transport segment appreciate the advantage of having only one “port of call”.</p></div>
